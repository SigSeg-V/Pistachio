# Pistachio

Pistachio is a fork of [Walnut](https://github.com/StudioCherno/Walnut) to provide cross-platform support and an up-to-date version of ImGui. Pistachio uses ImGui and Vulkan to allow the user to render GPU accelerated  viewports, useful for highly interactive or graphics-basde applications.

## Requirements
- CMake >= 3.29
- [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows)

## Getting Started
Simply clone this repo and link it to your executable. For convenience I have [created a template](https://github.com/SigSeg-V/PistachioAppTemplate) to facilitate creating new applications using this framework. I highly Recommend using this template for new applications.

### Additional
- Pistachio uses the [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) font ([Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0))
