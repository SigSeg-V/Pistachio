# Pistachio

Pistachio is a simple application framework built with Dear ImGui and designed to be used with Vulkan - basically this means you can seemlessly blend real-time Vulkan rendering with a great UI library to build desktop applications. The plan is to expand Pistachio to include common utilities to make immediate-mode desktop apps and simple Vulkan applications.

## Requirements
- CMake >= 3.29
- [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows)

## Getting Started
Simply clone this repo and link it to your executable. For convenience I have [created a template](https://github.com/SigSeg-V/PistachioAppTemplate) to facilitate creating new applications using this framework. I highly Recommend using this template for new applications.

### Additional
- Pistachio uses the [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) font ([Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0))
